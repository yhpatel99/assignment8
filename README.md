# Data Analysis and Visualization Assignments

## Assignment 1: Fisher's Iris Data Visualization

### Context
The Fisher's Iris dataset is a dataset in both data science and biology. The dataset will look to determine if species of irises can be identified by comparing the physical properties of different samples.

### Objective
Perform visual analysis of the Iris dataset by generating three different data visualizations. Each visualization should illustrate the differences in physical traits between the different species.

### Visualizations
1. **Scatter Plot of Sepal Length vs Sepal Width**
2. **Box Plot of Petal Length by Species**
3. **Pair Plot of All Features**


## Assignment 2: Loan Dataset Visualization

### Context
This assignment performs data visualization and analysis on a loan dataset. The visualizations include the distribution of loan amounts, loan amounts by current loan status, and interest rates by loan grade.

### Visualizations
1. **Distribution of Loan Amount by Current Loan Status**
2. **Loan Amount by Current Loan Status**
3. **Interest Rate by Loan Grade**
